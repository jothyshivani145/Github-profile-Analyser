⭐ GitHub Profile Analyser

GitHub Profile Analyser is a Flask-based web application that fetches and analyzes any GitHub user’s public profile using the GitHub REST API. It generates a recruiter-friendly summary showing top repositories, language usage, total stars, and profile activity — making it easy to evaluate a developer at a glance.

 Features

- Search any GitHub username

- View detailed profile info (bio, followers, following, avatar, etc.)

- Analyze repositories (stars, languages, total repos)

 Automatic insights like:

1.Most used languages

2.Top 5 repositories

3.Total star count

🎨 Clean UI for a recruiter-style profile view
